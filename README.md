# Crowdfunding_ETL
Two excel files were extracted and transformed into structured and cleaned data and then put in a Dataframe and exported as csv. Using these files an ERD was sketched and then used to create a tables schema in SQL Postgres.

In order to run this successfully this has been split into three separtate Jupyter notebooks.

1. [Category and Subcategory Dataframes](https://github.com/Rstevens318/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/Master/rina_category_subcategory_df.ipynb)

2. [Campaign Dataframe](https://github.com/Rstevens318/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/Master/Raleigh_campaign_df.ipynb)

3. [Contacts Dataframe](https://github.com/Rstevens318/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/Master/sam_contacts_df.ipynb)

Once these have been ran in order we can then setup a postgres database with our [Schema](https://github.com/Rstevens318/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/Master/Resources/crowdfunding_db_schema.sql).
