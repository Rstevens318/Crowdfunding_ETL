# Crowdfunding_ETL
Two excel files were extracted and tranformed into structured and cleaned data and then put in a Dataframe and exported as csv. Using these files an ERD was sketched and then used to create a tables schema in SQL Postgres.

The packages imported were: pandas as pd and numpy as np. Jupyter notebook was the notebook used and an SQL file was uploaded for the SQL table schema made. The SQL file can be found in the Resources folder.
